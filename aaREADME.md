# WCPSS-Code-Challenges
This repository includes solution code for educational code challenges.  Some files are based on existing riddles such as the TED-Ed series on YouTube.  Where appropriate a link to the video will be included in the code comments.  Others are code challenges I have seen on the web or made up myself.

The code is intended for teachers to use as a solution key after allowing the students to attempt to write the code.

I don't represent that the algorithms included here are the most efficient way to solve these problems.  While they do provide a solution, there may be (and likely are) better and more efficient ways to solve these problems.  I try to make the solutions be representative of some fundamental coding concepts that we want the students to learn.  For example, I may use a for loop to create a list and a list comprehension may be a faster and more elegant solution; however, the loop was a more accessible method of solution that is more aligned with the level of the students.

Enjoy!
