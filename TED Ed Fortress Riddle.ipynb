    "#### TED Ed Fortress Riddle\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the fortress riddle using Python.  What is the largest wall segment (less than or equal to 1000 meters wide) that can't be broken down by any combination of wall busters.  The enemy wall busters can be combined to destroy any combination of 6, 9 and 20 meter wide walls.  Since it takes the same time to build a large wall as a small wall, your engineers should focus on the largest possible walls that can't be destroyed.  See video below:\n",
